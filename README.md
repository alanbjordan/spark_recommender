# Spark ALS Movie Recommendation System

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build a movie recommendation system using Apache Spark's Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm. The notebook leverages the MovieLens dataset to train and evaluate a recommendation model.

## Overview

The goal of this notebook is to provide an end-to-end example of building a collaborative filtering recommendation system using Spark's ALS model. The notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Data Loading:** Load and preprocess the MovieLens dataset, which consists of user ratings for movies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examine the structure and content of the datasets.
3. **Model Training:** Train an ALS model using the user-movie ratings data.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system.
5. **Recommendation Generation:** Generate movie recommendations for users based on the trained model.
